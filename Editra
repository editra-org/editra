#  Launch script for the Editor. It first tries to look for Editra on the  #
# local path and if it is not there it tries to import the Main method     #
# from where Editra would be installed if it was installed using disutils  #
#                                                                          #

# XXX plugins need to have the import paths of the libraries they use taken
#     care of in someway to allow for them to work regardless of where the
#     application is executed from.
#
#     i.e  from Editra/Editra (this script), or from Editra/src/Editra.py
#
#     For them to work from this script they need to import relative to this
#     script. (import src.plugin) as apposed to (import plugin), but visa versa
#     is required for the other main script. This is further complicated by the
#     fact that the location of this script is never guaranteed. So the current
#     solution is to change to the directory where the main is located and tell
#     the system to execute the script there and then change back to the
#     current directory in the main. If there is anyone that has a more clever 
#     way to deal with this I would like to listen.
#
# XXX Note for this to work the version of python on the path must be the one
#     that has all of Editra's dependancies installed on.
