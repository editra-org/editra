Changes since last release:

VERSION 0.2.65
DATE 02/08/2008
10th Alpha Release

NEWS:
This release includes major improvements to the detection and handling of file
encodings and reporting of related errors when they happen. As part of this
enhancement support for magic encoding comments are now supported in the editor
for specifying an encoding for a document. The comment must be found on either
the first or second line of the file. All popular comment formats are supported,

example1: # -*- encoding: utf-8 *-*
example2: # vim: set fileencoding=latin-1 :
example3: # coding=utf-16

When no encoding is specified the default will be to use utf-8 for encoding text
when possible and falling back to other available system encodings when utf-8
fails.

There is also a new bundled plugin that is distributed with this release. The
plugin is called Launch ant it is the highly requested solution to be able to 
run scripts from within Editra. It currently supports most of the scripting
languages that Editra has support for and provides custom output parsing and
filtering for some languages such as python. The special output handling will
create hotspots on error messages in the output and allow you to instantly
navigate to the error by clicking on the hotspot.


NEW: [features/improvements]
+New bundled plugin "Launch" for running scripts and viewing output.
+Support for using C style (/* */) comments in Editra Style Sheets
+Improved syntax highlighting sample/test files
+Highlighting support for (Ferite, haXe)
+Use Softtabs by default
+Option to use backspace to dedent when in an indent region
+Support for magic comments as described in pep 0263 for setting the encoding
 of a document. If an encoding is not explicitly set the default will still be
 to use utf-8.
+Improved unicode support
+Option to set a preferred lexer for new files so highlighting and other 
features are automatically applied when starting a new buffer.
+New plugin "CommentBrowser" for listing and browsing TODO statements in the
current buffer is available.
+Two new icon themes available (Crystal Project and Ubuntoon)
+All existing icon themes have received some minor updates
+Improved Windows installer / Better Windows Desktop integration
+Log Viewer can filter messages based on their origin
+Updated Russian and Japanese Translations

BUG FIXES:
+Fix bug with turning off syntax highlighting in the preference dialog
+Exiting Editra from a right click on the Windows taskbar saving invalid window
size and position for next launch.
+Add some missing Ruby keywords

disabled in the Shelf menu when an instance is already open.

VERSION 0.2.15
DATE 10/30/2007
7th Alpha Release

NEWS:
This is mostly a bug fix release that resolves a number of issues throughout the
editor. Most notably are a correction to some performance issues on Mac OSX,
a number of UI related issues on Linux, and a fair number of fixes to the
Style Editor.

From this release onwards updating to the new version of Editra will no longer 
require you to reconfigure all of your preferences as profiles are now incrementally
updated so only settings that need to be changed or added are while not affecting
all the other saved settings.

There is also a number of new plugins available with this release, most notably
it is the first public release of the Projects plugin.  The Projects plugin 
transparently works with your file system and source control.  When you add a 
project (i.e., a directory) to the plugin, you can open files in the editor 
simply by double-clicking them in the tree view.  Files that are selected in 
the editor will automatically display in the tree view if that file exists in 
one of your registered projects.  In addition, the Projects plugin tracks files 
under source control (CVS, Subversion, and GIT).  The status of the file is 
displayed in the file's icon, and most source control operations are available 
from the right-click menu.  For more information on the plugin and it's 
configuration options see <http://code.google.com/p/editra-plugins/wiki/ProjectsPlugin>.

NEW: [features/improvements]
+Projects management plugin available through PluginManager.
+Icon themes are now part of the plugin system so themes can be created and
installed through the plugin manager using python eggs.
+New icon themes based on the Humility and Oxygen icon sets available through plugin manager.
+Improved highlighting for python (decorators are now supported)
+Support for highlighting (Edje EDC files, Gui4Cli, Inno Setup Scripts, KIX, Verilog)
+Support for highlighting DOT files (contributed by Rob McMullen)
